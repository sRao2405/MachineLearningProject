# ABOUT THE PROJECT 
This project uses supervised machine learning to predict housing prices based on various features like total rooms, population, and location. 
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning using a Random Forest and Linear Regression model.


# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Predict the median house value using features such as:
1. Total rooms
2. Total bedrooms
3. Population
4. Households
5. Ocean proximity (categorical)
6. Engineered features like bedroom-to-room ratio
